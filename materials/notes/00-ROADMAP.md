## 🎓 Important Reminders

### **When You Feel Stuck:**
1. That's normal - everyone struggles
2. Take a break, come back fresh
3. Draw the problem on paper
4. Start with brute force, optimize later
5. Read solutions, but understand WHY

### **Consistency Over Intensity:**
- 1 hour daily > 7 hours on Sunday
- Better to solve 2 problems deeply than 10 superficially
- Review > Moving forward without understanding

### **Interview Mindset:**
- Always think out loud
- Start with clarifying questions
- Discuss brute force before optimizing
- Test your code with examples
- Handle edge cases

---

## 🏆 Success Metrics

**You'll know you're ready when:**
- You can solve most medium problems in 30-45 minutes
- You recognize patterns immediately
- You can explain your approach clearly
- You handle edge cases without being told
- You're excited (not scared) to see new problems
