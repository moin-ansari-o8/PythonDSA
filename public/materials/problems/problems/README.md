## Getting Started

Problems are organized by data structure and algorithm category. Each problem includes:
- Clear problem statement
- Input/output examples
- Constraints
- Hints (if needed)

## Practice Strategy

1. Read the problem carefully
2. Identify the pattern
3. Think through edge cases
4. Code the solution
5. Test thoroughly
6. Analyze complexity

// consistent practice builds intuition
