## 🎓 Learning Principles

### ✅ **Do This:**
- Understand concepts before coding
- Struggle for 30+ minutes before checking solutions
- Explain your approach out loud (interview practice!)
- Review previous problems weekly
- Track your progress consistently

### ❌ **Avoid This:**
- Memorizing solutions without understanding
- Tutorial hell (watching without doing)
- Skipping "easy" problems (they build foundation!)
- Comparing yourself to others
- Giving up when stuck (stuck = growth!)

---

## 📊 Track Your Progress

Use [progress/TRACKER.md](./progress/TRACKER.md) to:
- Monitor weekly goals
- Track problems solved by topic
- Maintain study streaks
- Reflect on learnings
- Identify weak areas

**Update it daily!** Seeing progress is motivating.

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

### **What You Need:**
- ✅ Basic Python knowledge (loops, functions, lists, dicts)
- ✅ Code editor (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)
- ✅ 1-2 hours daily commitment
- ✅ Determination & patience

### **What You Don't Need:**
- ❌ CS degree
- ❌ Prior DSA knowledge
- ❌ Math wizardry
- ❌ Genius-level IQ

**Anyone can master this with consistency!**

---

## 🎯 Daily Routine (Suggested)

### **Weekday Schedule (2 hours):**
- **30 min** - Read theory/concepts from notes
- **1 hour** - Solve 2-3 problems actively
- **30 min** - Review solutions, learn patterns

### **Weekend Schedule (Flexible):**
- Review week's topics
- Redo challenging problems
- Explore additional resources
- Plan next week

---

## 💡 Problem-Solving Approach

### **For Every Problem:**

1. **Understand** - Read 2-3 times, identify inputs/outputs
2. **Examples** - Create test cases (including edge cases)
3. **Brute Force** - Think simplest solution first
4. **Optimize** - Identify patterns, use right data structures
5. **Code** - Write clean, commented code
6. **Test** - Trace through examples
7. **Review** - Learn alternative approaches

**Budget: 45-60 minutes per problem**

---

## 🧩 Problem Categories

## 🤔 When You're Stuck

**It's normal!** Here's what to do:

1. **Take a break** - Fresh eyes help
2. **Draw it out** - Visualize on paper
3. **Start simple** - Brute force first
4. **Use print statements** - See what's happening
5. **Check templates** - See similar patterns
6. **Review after 45 min** - Don't waste hours guessing
7. **Understand, don't memorize** - Ask WHY, not just HOW

---

## 💪 Motivation

### **Remember:**

> **"Everyone you admire was once a beginner who refused to give up."**

- DSA is **learnable** - not reserved for geniuses
- **Consistency > Intensity** - 1 hour daily beats 7 hours on Sunday
- **Struggling means growing** - If it's easy, you're not learning
- **Plateaus are normal** - Progress isn't linear
- **You WILL succeed** - Thousands before you did, you will too

---

## 🎙️ Interview Tips

### **During Interviews:**

1. **Think out loud** - Explain your approach
2. **Ask clarifying questions** - Show you think critically
3. **Start with brute force** - Then optimize
4. **Test your code** - Walk through examples
5. **Handle edge cases** - Empty input, single element, etc.
6. **Discuss complexity** - Time & space analysis
7. **Be honest if stuck** - Ask for hints
